# To do

## Editor

* Only disabled data wranglers should be editable (the prevent scheduled runs while editing)
* Edit single transform
* Do we need (to implement) AbstractTransformer::transformColumns so we cat check transformed columns with processing actual data?

## Data targets

* API
* Database

## Scheduled tasks

Some task runner should run data wranglers at fixed intervals or at a fixed time of day.

## Naming

* “transform” vs. “transformer”
* “options” vs. “parameters” vs. “arguments”
